# ðŸš€ About Me
### I'm Nischayee â€” a Bristol-based data scientist trained in scientific thinking and built for real-world impact. I specialize in explainable models, time-series forecasting, and data tools that donâ€™t just work â€” they matter. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and statistical modelling, I build solutions that uncover patterns, drive decisions, and scale with purpose. If it involves signal, structure, or systems â€” Iâ€™m in.
